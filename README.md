# ALC4Phase1

This is a simple android application with three activities.

The first activity is the main activity (Activity A) with two buttons. Button 1 takes you to Activity B when clicked. Button 2 takes you to Activity C when clicked.

Activity B is the About ALC page. It contains only a Webview that loads the URL "https://andela.com/alc/". 

Activity C is your profile page. It contains an ImageView which should display your photo and TextViews showing your Name, Track, Country, Email and Phone Number.
